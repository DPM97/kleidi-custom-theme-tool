Tool to create custom themes/skins for the Kleidi service

## Tool Installation

## How To Use

One of our example themes can be found in the **theme** directory. 
These are the files that should be edited / replaced in order to create a theme successfully.

After editing, your **theme** directory should still look like this

## Theme Installation
1. Copy the **theme** folder to another location
2. Rename the theme folder to your desired theme name
3. Compress said folder into a .zip file
4. Upload the zip file to your database via the Kleidi admin panel

**IMPORTANT - make sure your zip file is the same name as the folder being zipped!**
