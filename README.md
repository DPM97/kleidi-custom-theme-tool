## Theme Installation
1. Copy the **yourservicename** folder to another location
2. For this to work, the theme folder must be equal to that of your kleidi service name!!!!
3. Compress said folder into a .zip file
4. Upload the zip file to our service via your admin panel & choose "custom" as your theme option

**IMPORTANT - make sure your zip file is the same name as the folder being zipped!**
